      <description>This past week was spent learning the wonders of Responsive CSS. We spent a small amount of time learning media queries, which is fine sense itâ€™s a fairly simple concept. It just involves more hacking around, just with considerations for specific screen sizes. The first part of our homework was to refactor our week one Portfolio Site utilizing media queries. That in itself did not take too much time. The second part of the homework is to refactor the original site using Bootstrap 4.</description>
