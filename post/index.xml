      <description>Not a ton of new content was covered this week. The first day we had a Javascript review, where we went over previous content with the lens of what we know now. I did not get much of this day, since everything we have learned is still fresh. The second day we covered Javascript Timing Events. What we learned that day was enough for us to tackle our week five homework.</description>

      <description>This was probably my favorite week yet. Some of the concepts are starting to stick, my ability to think programmatically is improving. We went into Javascript and jQuery a little more in depth. The concept of scope was covered extensively. My prior experience helped out immensely.
And to get into my prior experience. My first formal introduction into programming while we had a Clinton in the White House. Things were rosy.</description>

      <description>This week was spent getting acquainted with Javascript. Which is a scripting language that adds functionality to websites. It can be used to manipulate the page itself, such as adding elements, text, images. It can also be used to to do nitty-gritty things, like math. I do have a good amount of experience with programming languages, but it has been a while since I have had to think programmatically. Everyone programming language as its own quirks.</description>

      <title>Week Two, Part 2</title>

      <description>I submitted my homework. I am not thrilled with my work. I spent many hours trying hacking away at the Bootstrap-Portfolio trying to format it to spec. My biggest isssue is that the breakpoints in our spec are not the same as the breakpoints that Bootstrap 4 uses. The easiest way to have fixed this would have been to customized my own downloaded version of Bootstrap by using Sass, which is something that seemed overly complicated at the time.</description>

      <description>This past week was spent learning the wonders of Responsive CSS. We spent a small amount of time learning media queries, which is fine sense itâ€™s a fairly simple concept. It just involves more hacking around, just with considerations for specific screen sizes. The first part of our homework was to refactor our week one Portfolio Site utilizing media queries. That in itself did not take too much time. The second part of the homework is to refactor the original site using Bootstrap 4.</description>

      <description>I am really excited to start a new chapter in my life and puruse something that I am passionate about. It has been a real treat to face challenges and overcome them. Over the next 23 weeks I will transform myself into a Full Stack Developer.
First Weeks Homework My first project was to recrate a Personal Portfolio site from spec. It was a real drag getting all the content to align, utilizing floats and then clearing the floats.</description>
