      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a challenging last couple of weeks. We concurrently covered testing, both unit and functional, and completed our second group project. One of the toughest aspects of our group project is simply coming up with an idea for an application. We kicked around a few ideas, but eventually led drawing game, kind of like Pictionary, where one player has a clue and other player must guess what the drawer is, &lt;em&gt;drawing&lt;/em&gt;. We came across WebSockets, which allows for peer to peer communication between over TCP. This would allow us to share what the person is drawing on their Canvas. We used Socket.io, which implements WebSockets and ties in nicely with Node. Also using Socket.io, I implemented a chat function, which was also used as a method the messages that control the functions of the game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a short week in terms of new material, as it was running concurrently with the planning of our second group project. We build off the knowledge we gained last week in building our own ORM, and used an off the shelf model, &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Sequelize&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;. I found Sequelize itself to be pretty easy to use, since it is promise based. Dealing with callbacks can get messy. Our project this week was merely to refactor last week&amp;rsquo;s project, were we created are own ORM, using Sequelize.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
