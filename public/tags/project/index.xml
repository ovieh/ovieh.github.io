      <description>&lt;p&gt;The remaining three weeks of class were mainly devoted to the development of our final projects. In that time we we also covered React in more depth and went over some some Computer Science fundamental, data structure and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not quite sure why I am so fond of React. Perhaps it feels like it gives needed structure to the front-end. And adding even more structure, we covered Redux. &lt;a href=&#34;https://redux.js.org/&#34;&gt;Redux&lt;/a&gt; provides a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. What that means is that handles the state for your entire application, it provides a &lt;em&gt;single source of truth&lt;/em&gt;. For something that is relatively simple, it is difficult to grasp exactly why you would need or want to use Redux. Through abstraction it provides predictable methods of accessing and modifying state. I would go on to use it along with React in my groupâ€™s final project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
