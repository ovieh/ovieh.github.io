      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to create a &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;project&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; to familiarize myself with some newer additions to React. I built upon a previous full stack web app I created that uses Handlebars for the view layer. This new app uses some new features in React, such as Hooks and Concurrent React. The app scrapes the New York Times Technology page and displays a list of articles to user. It also allows the user to save articles and to comment on those articles. The backed uses MongoDB and Mongoose as ORM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week we added another tool to our toolbox, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mongodb.com/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;. And unlike MySQL, it does not care what you put in to it. It just accepts the data. Which is a blessing and a curse. To remedy this, there exists a project called &lt;a href=&#34;http://mongoosejs.com/&#34;&gt;Mongoose&lt;/a&gt;. Mongoose provides a MondoDB database with an ORM, which allows for validation. Since we previously learned Firebase, it was relatively easy to pick up Mongo. We just had to learn how to implement it with Node.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
