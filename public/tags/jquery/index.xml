      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was probably my favorite week yet. Some of the concepts are starting to stick, my ability to think programmatically is improving. We went into Javascript and jQuery a little more in depth. The concept of scope was covered extensively. My prior experience helped out immensely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And to get into my prior experience. My first formal introduction into programming while we had a Clinton in the White House. Things were rosy. There was a Dot Com boom. Geocities were a thing. In Ms. Futchâ€™s class we learned Microsoft Visual Basic. I was always adept at following instructions and understanding what makes instructions clear, so inputting instructions into a computer felt natural to me. Our programming teacher had no programming experience, and as the course went on, I began helping my fellow students out with our work more and more. It all seemed so simple to me. Maybe it had something to do with the simple nature of Visual Basic. Dragging and Dropping UI elements around and assigning simple logic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
