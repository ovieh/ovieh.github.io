      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week we added another tool to our toolbox, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mongodb.com/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;. And unlike MySQL, it does not care what you put in to it. It just accepts the data. Which is a blessing and a curse. To remedy this, there exists a project called &lt;a href=&#34;http://mongoosejs.com/&#34;&gt;Mongoose&lt;/a&gt;. Mongoose provides a MondoDB database with an ORM, which allows for validation. Since we previously learned Firebase, it was relatively easy to pick up Mongo. We just had to learn how to implement it with Node.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a challenging last couple of weeks. We concurrently covered testing, both unit and functional, and completed our second group project. One of the toughest aspects of our group project is simply coming up with an idea for an application. We kicked around a few ideas, but eventually led drawing game, kind of like Pictionary, where one player has a clue and other player must guess what the drawer is, &lt;em&gt;drawing&lt;/em&gt;. We came across WebSockets, which allows for peer to peer communication between over TCP. This would allow us to share what the person is drawing on their Canvas. We used Socket.io, which implements WebSockets and ties in nicely with Node. Also using Socket.io, I implemented a chat function, which was also used as a method the messages that control the functions of the game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
