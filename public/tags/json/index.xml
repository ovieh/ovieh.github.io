      <description>&lt;p&gt;The  last couple of weeks were spent working on our first group project. It was quite the learning experience. The first obstacle was to figure out what exactly we should do for a project. I first suggested a music based food recommendation app. That really did not go anywhere. Itâ€™s not a terrible idea. We eventually landed on an app that would give you movie recommendations based on your facial expression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
