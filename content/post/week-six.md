This week we learned ways of accessing tools and data not of our creation through APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces. This is a pretty important step in our learning progression, since no man is an island, it is fundamental to learn to leverage the work of others. I think the most important lesson I learned this week was importance of reading documentation. When I think about it, I have always enjoyed reading instructions. As I child, when i got any toy that required assembly, half the fun was learning how to put the thing together. Now I get to find job in assembling disparate pieces of software.

This weeks project was to use Giphyâ€™s API to display ten GIFs based on predefined topics and allowing to add your topics. Upon clicking, the gifs would animate and when clicked again, the gifs will stop.
