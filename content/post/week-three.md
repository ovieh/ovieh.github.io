This week was spent getting acquainted with Javascript. Which is a scripting language that adds functionality to websites. It can be used to manipulate the page itself, such as adding elements, text, images. It can also be used to to do nitty-gritty things, like math. I do have a good amount of experience with programming languages, but it has been a while since I have had to think programmatically. Everyone programming language as its own quirks. How they handle variable scoping, how they treat variables, numbers, and so on.

This weeks homework was to make a simple Hangman-like game. The challenge was in the planning. I tried to keep my code DRY, which stands for Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself. I put blocks of code that would be used multiple times in functions that could be called when needed. Here is a [link](http://www.ovieh.com/Hangman-Game/ "link to project") to the finished working game.
