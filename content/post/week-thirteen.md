We are starting to put it all together. Our project this week was to create a friend recommendation app not dissimilar from Tinder. It is *almost* a full-stack app, it doesn’t quite have data persistence through a database. Class is starting to get complicated, but when you step back and think about things, the concepts make more sense. When you are running a web server, it makes perfect sense that your server won’t serve something it has no idea about, such as static files, unless you explicitly do so. We had been using Github Pages, which is perfectly fine for serving static sites and does all of the heavy lifting in terms of hosting a site. Setting up route with Express.js is actually pretty simple. And for our assignment, we also set up a rudimentary API to store and access data locally.

I also tried to make my web app look decent. My wonderful partner has noticed that many new web services and apps are using a color referred to as ‘Millennial Pink’, so using Materialize I choose it has the basis for my sites color theme.

Below are screenshots of my two views and here are links to the <a href="https://github.com/ovieh/FriendFinder" target="_blank">source</a> and the <a href="https://finderoffriends.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">deployed</a> website.
