Not a ton of new content was covered this week. The first day we had a Javascript review, where we went over previous content with the lens of what we know now. I did not get much of this day, since everything we  have learned is still fresh. The second day we covered Javascript Timing Events. What we learned that day was enough for us to tackle our week five homework. The goal was to create a trivia game where the user has a limited amount of time to answer the question before the game moved on to the next question.

I have also been working on creating better Javascript code in general, trying to learn about best practices and where the industry is going. I stopped myself from also trying to concurrently learn Golang for the backend, but I think I will focus on becoming competent at Javascript first. On my following homework assignment, I will try and use more features of ES6 and see if they can improve my code.
