I am really excited to start a new chapter in my life and puruse something
that I am passionate about. It has been a real treat to face challenges
and overcome them. Over the next 23 weeks I will transform myself into a Full Stack Developer.

## First Weeks Homework

My first project was to recrate a Personal Portfolio site from spec. It was a real drag getting all 
the content to align, utilizing floats and then clearing the floats. I spent several hours hacking away, adding padding and margins,
to get everything as close to the spec as possible. Below I will link a screenshot of my final draft.
