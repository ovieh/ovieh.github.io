Until now our programs only cared about the *now*, they only lived in the *moment*. This week we learned ways of giving our software something that dogs do not have, object permanence. We covered three ways of storing data with Javascript just using what’s in the browser; HTML5 Web Storage as well touching on Cookies. On the third day we covered the use of a Google product, <a href=”https://firebase.google.com/” target=”_blank”>Firebase</a>. The database feature from Firebase includes a couple of really useful features, namely, in our use at least, a method that listens to changes in the database and call a function. This can really simplify the number of functions that are needed to be created.

Our latest homework project was the create a train scheduling site that implements the database feature from Firebase. In order to handle various time problems, we used <a href="https://momentjs.com/" target="_blank">Moment.js</a>, which is a handy Javascript library that can be used to format time. My one regret is that there is not a .JS subdomain, that would make the URL that much cooler.

Here is as link to the <a href="http://www.ovieh.com/TrainScheduler" target="_blank">live</a> version of my project and along with a link the <a href="https://www.github.com/ovieh/TrainScheduler" target="_blank">source</a> on Github.
