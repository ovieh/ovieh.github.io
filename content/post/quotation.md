I use Hugo to generate html for site. I have been using Google Docs to draft posts, to take advantage of spell check. What I did not realize, is that the quotation marks that are used in word processing programs and quotation marks used in html are *not* the same. This lead to to dead links in previous two posts. Live and learn.
