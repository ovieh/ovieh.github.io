      <description>This last week I became reaquainted with MySQL. Itâ€™s not so bad. The syntax is relatively straightforward. The keywords are close to to natural language. This was another week getting familiar with the power of Node.js. It is really easy to integrate some really powerful tools.
Our assignment this week was to create backend for store using MySQL running on Node.js.Working with MySQL was pretty straightforward, updating, selecting from, and inserting into the database.</description>
