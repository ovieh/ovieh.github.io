      <description>It has been a challenging last couple of weeks. We concurrently covered testing, both unit and functional, and completed our second group project.

      <description>This was a short week in terms of new material, as it was running concurrently with the planning of our second group project.

Dealing with callbacks can get messy. Our project this week was merely to refactor last week&amp;rsquo;s project, were we created are own ORM, using Sequelize.</description>
