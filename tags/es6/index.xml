      <description>So this is where the fun started. React is such joy to work with. Having once source for truth makes a lot sense. I have been picking up ES6 &amp;amp; ES7 features for a while now, and now its interesting seeing things like object destruturing and spread and rest used in a library. I really was not having much fun working on the front end, until now. I guess its the way that problems are approached, from Reacts perspective.</description>
